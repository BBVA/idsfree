What's a isolated environment?
------------------------------

When you do hacking tasks, is very common to run these tasks in a controlled environment.

This is special important to test just developed applications and you need to test it before it will be released. 
 
In this cases it necessary to create a most similar scenario of the real system and then the auditor starts to run the hacking tasks.
 
In hacking-slang is most usual to name the *environment* as *laboratory*
